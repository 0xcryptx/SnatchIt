    <img src="path/to/your/logo.png" alt="SnatchIt Logo" style="height: 40px;">
    <h1>SnatchIt</h1>
</div>
```

### Adding Products

Edit the `products` array in `script.js`:

```javascript
const products = [
    {
        id: 1,
        name: "Your Product Name",
        description: "Product description here",
        price: 99.99,
        category: "electronics", // Must match filter options
        image: "fas fa-headphones", // FontAwesome icon class
        affiliateLink: "https://your-affiliate-link.com"

    // Add more products...
];
```
